Prototyping a connected button-pusher.

---

Before working on [Sunse√Ø]({{site.url}}/Sunsei), I had the idea with a friend to develop Pushroom, a connected button-pusher.
The goal was to be able to turn (almost) any existing appliance into a connected object, by adding a small adaptator to it
that would press its button when prompted.
We also wanted to allow the pushers to interact with each other.
You could for example connect your alarm clock and your coffee machine.
That way, when you woke up and stopped the alarm clock, your coffee would start heating up, offering you those extra 2 minutes of bedtime we all want.

Being both engineering students, we quickly decided to build a prototype, and took part in a hackathon organised by the [Microsoft Innovation Center](http://www.mic-belgique.be) in Mons, Belgium.
With the help of another friend, and with the available hardware, we tried to get a working result in 24 hours.
We decided to focus on light switches, as well as on a switch that opened a sliding door to access the building.

As a result, we built a frame that could be firmly attached to a switch while also being easy to remove.
We included a servo-motor that could turn both ways to turn the lights on and off.
We moved the motor and connected the pusher to the local wifi through a Raspberry Pi, which was powered by a portable battery.
Finally, everything was controlled via an Android app we built on the spot.
