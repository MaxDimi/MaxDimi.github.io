While working on [Pushroom]({{site.url}}/Pushroom) with a friend, we got hooked on IoT and the possibilities it offers.
We decided to move on from the small gadget that the previous project was to work on helping the owners of photovoltaic systems to better use their electricity.

The problem is fairly simple: solar panels produce energy during the day, while people tend to consume it in the evening.
This causes extensive exchanges between the house and the grid: first to inject the excess of electricity produced, and then a second time to pump back electricity from the grid.
This leads to increased costs for the network manager.
Therefore, most countries are implementing strategies to compensate those costs, and they generally require the households to pay for their use of the grid.

The best way to ensure the profitability of a photovoltaic system is to maximize self-consumption: that is to directly consume the electricity produced, without using the grid.
Two strategies (which can be combined) exist: shifting the supply, or shifting the demand.
The first is usually done with batteries that store electricity during the day to be used later.
For our project, we decided to focus on the second.

Sunseï is a smart monitor for solar panels.
It takes into account the weather forecast and the real-time production/consumption of the house to determine the optimal time to use different appliances.
In the morning, or the day before, the house occupants set up those appliances (e.g. washing machine, dryer, dishwasher...) and create a task list.
The monitor then predicts the best schedule to maximize self-consumption.
When the time comes, it communicates through the Internet of Things (IoT) with the appliances to turn them on and off.
This can also be done with simple smart plugs, there is no need to replace old machines.

We currently are a team of 4 students: two engineering, one business and one law student.
We are hosted by the [Yncubator](https://www.yncubator.be), and we follow the entrepreneurship program of our university ([CPME](https://uclouvain.be/en/faculties/lsm/cpme)).
The prototype is in development.
