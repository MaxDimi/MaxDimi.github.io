<p>
I am a Belgian software developer with an Engineering diploma based in Montreal, QC.
I have a strong interest in entrepreneurship, new technologies, and urban farming.

<p>
On the technical side, my professional interests include new technologies (e.g. blockchain, IoT), data science, computer security...
Diversity of tasks is also very important for me: I like to learn by doing and to experiment in different fields, whether it is technical, social, or business related.

I have 2 years of experience working for a Montreal startup in industrial automation, using mainly
Go to develop IoT micro-services on the product.
I enjoy prototyping and developing new things from scratch, while following best practices and creating
a solid design to make the development as smooth and efficient as possible.

I have developed a passion for urban farming in the past year, having created two different hydroponics systems at home (one NFT and one DWC).
In my opinion, rethinking our approach to food production and consumption is vital in the fight against climate change.
