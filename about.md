<p>
I am a Computer Science Engineering student with a strong interest in entrepreneurship.
I am currently looking for work in the area of Montr√©al, Canada, starting around September 2019, preferably in a startup or SME or an organization closely related to entrepreneurship.

My professional interests include new technologies (e.g. blockchain, IoT), data science, computer security...
Diversity of tasks is also very important for me: I like to learn by doing and to experiment in different fields, whether it is technical, social, or business related.
I am looking for a meaningful job, with a real positive impact on our society, in a dynamic and challenging environment.
